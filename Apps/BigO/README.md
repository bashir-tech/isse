# BigO.ipynb
This project contains a Jupyter notebook file (BigO.ipynb) that analyzes the time complexity of various algorithms using Big O notation.

To run the notebook, you will need to have Python installed on your computer. If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from the official website: 
## https://www.python.org/downloads/

Once you have Python installed, you can install the necessary packages by running the following commands in your terminal or command prompt:

* py -m ensurepip --default-pip
* pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
These commands will ensure that pip is installed, and then install the required packages (NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib) for the project.

After installing the required packages, you can open the BigO.ipynb file in Jupyter notebook and run the cells to see the time complexity analysis of the algorithms.
